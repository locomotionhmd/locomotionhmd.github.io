## Abstract
Locomotion in Virtual Reality (VR) acts as a motion tracking unit for simulating user movements. They are rotational, axial, or translational in type, based on the Degree-of-Freedom (DOF) of VR application. For effective locomotion, VR practitioners may have to transform their hardware from 3-DOF to 6-DOF or vice versa. In this context, we conducted a literature review on different motion tracking methods employed in the Head-Mounted-Devices (HMD) to understand such hardware transformation to conduct locomotion in VR. Our observations led us to formulate a taxonomy of the tracking methods for locomotion in VR based on system design. Our study also captures different metrics that VR practitioners use to evaluate the hardware based on the context, performance, and significance of its usage for conducting locomotion.
